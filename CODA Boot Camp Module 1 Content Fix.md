# CODA Boot Camp Module 1 Content Fix

This directory contains the fix for the missing content in Module 1 of your CODA boot camp website.

## Issue Identified

The Module 1 page (`module1.html`) is missing its content. While the page structure and navigation exist, the actual educational content is missing from the page. This appears to have happened during the rebranding from AI Docx to CODA, where the content wasn't properly transferred or updated.

## Solution

I've created a comprehensive content file (`module1_content.html`) that contains all the HTML content needed for Module 1: "Introduction to AI for Document Processing & Collaboration". This content matches the style, depth, and quality of the other modules in your boot camp.

## How to Fix the Issue

To fix the Module 1 content issue, follow these steps:

1. Access your website files on the Vercel deployment or your source repository.

2. Open the `module1.html` file in a code editor.

3. Locate the `<article class="module-body">` section in the file. It likely contains only comments like:
   ```html
   <!-- Module content remains the same but with updated styling -->
   <!-- Content from original module1.html -->
   ```

4. Replace everything between the `<article class="module-body">` opening tag and its closing `</article>` tag with the content from the `module1_content.html` file provided in this directory.

5. Save the file and deploy the changes to your website.

## Content Structure

The provided Module 1 content includes four comprehensive sections:

1. **Understanding Document Intelligence**
   - Evolution of Document Processing
   - Key Components of Document Intelligence
   - Business Impact of Document Intelligence

2. **AI Technologies for Documents**
   - Core AI Technologies
   - Document-Specific AI Models
   - Implementation Approaches

3. **Collaboration Transformation**
   - Traditional vs. AI-Enhanced Collaboration
   - Collaborative Intelligence
   - Collaboration Platforms and Integration

4. **Getting Started with AI Tools**
   - Assessment and Planning
   - Technology Selection
   - Implementation Best Practices

## Verification

After implementing the fix, verify that:

1. All sections of Module 1 are displaying correctly
2. Navigation between sections works properly
3. All formatting, tables, and special elements render as expected

If you encounter any issues with the implementation, please let me know, and I'll provide additional assistance.
